    <p> My midterm project will be a blog about bees. I've been working on a side project lately where I get to learn about bees and also get to work with them. Because of this, I have a lot of information to fill the blog with. The first page will be clean and simple, yet also hold links to other pages. The main page will also feature a photo or video of a bee (just so it's emphasised that the blog is about bees).</p>
    <p>The main page will link to other pages, such as "about bees," "why bees are important," "sources to learn about beekeeping." Each of the individual pages will be longer than the main page, and hold more information such as paragraphs of information, more photos and instructional videos.</p>
